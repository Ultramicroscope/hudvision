[HUDV](https://laby.net/@d1c4b70c-e4df-4ed6-999a-2e959bdfdac7), the legendary Minecraft player, showed off a cool post-processing video effect that highlights motion.

It was done via "***duplicate layer invert colours set opacity to 50% and then just move it forwards a few frames***"

This shader attempts to recreate that technique but in real-time.
